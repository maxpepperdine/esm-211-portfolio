## MQMF Library and the Baranov Catch Equation

Describes survivorship following the combination of fishing and natural mortality, but the simple Z for total mortality implied that all fish suffered the same fishing mortality. If we are to take account of selectivity then we need to consider fishing mortality at age.

Where Sa,t is the survivorship of fish aged a in year t, M is the natural mortality (assumed constant through time), sa is the selectivity for age a, and Ft is known as the fully selected fishing mortality in year t.

## Baranov Catch Equation Setup

```{r}

# Age range of California halibut 
#(California halibut can live up to 30 years, individuals older than 15 years are rare)
age_range <- 0:30

# 22% (0.22) is a hypothetical value
harvest_rate = 0.22
# Compute the instantaneous fishing mortality (Ft = −ln(1 − harvest_rate))
# Ft ≈ 0.2231 or fishing mortality is about 22.3% per year
instantaneous_fishing_mortality <- -log(1 - harvest_rate) 

# Fishing mortality (F) at age (n)
fishing_mortality_n <- rep(instantaneous_fishing_mortality, length(age_range))

# Studies have estimated the natural mortality rate (M) for California halibut 20% per year.
# Natural Mortality (M)
M <- 0.20

# Initial population size of 1000 is a hypothetical value
# Actual population depend on stock assessments and environmental conditions
# Initial Population (Nt)
Nt <- 1000

bce_data <- bce(M, Fat = fishing_mortality_n, Nt, ages=age_range) 

```

## Examine the data output

You should also grab each date field from the bce() function output to run further analysis

```{r}

print(bce_data)

california_halibut_data <- extract_bce_data(bce_data)

```

## Quick Look: Fish Population at Age

```{r}

plot_fish_population(age_range, california_halibut_data$population_at_age)


```

## Plot the Catch at Age (n) Distribution

```{r}

plot_catch_at_age(age_range, california_halibut_data$catch_at_age)


```

## Plot the Species Population and Catch at Age for Species

```{r}

plot_population_vs_catch(age_range, california_halibut_data$population_at_age, california_halibut_data$catch_at_age)


```

# Now It's you turn:

```{r}

# ----------------------------------------
# Baranov catch equation setup 
# ----------------------------------------

# Age range (i.e. 0:20)
age_range <- NULL


# 22% (0.22) is a hypothetical value, adjust it to see how harvest affects your population
harvest_rate = 0.22
# Compute the instantaneous fishing mortality (Ft = −ln(1 − harvest_rate))
# Ft ≈ 0.2231 or fishing mortality is about 22.3% per year
instantaneous_fishing_mortality <- -log(1 - harvest_rate) 

# Fishing mortality (F) at age (n)
fishing_mortality_n <- rep(instantaneous_fishing_mortality, length(age_range))

# Natural Mortality (M) (i.e. .20)
M <- NULL

# Initial population size of 1000 is a hypothetical example
# Actual population depend on stock assessments and environmental conditions
# Initial Population (Nt)
Nt <- NULL

if (is.null(age_range) | is.null(M) | is.null(Nt)) {
      stop("Error: Please fill in age range, natural mortality, and population size for your species. If you are having trouble finding them online, please use a value that makes sense.")
}

bce_data <- bce(M, Fat = fishing_mortality_n, Nt, ages=age_range) 

print(bce_data)

your_species_data <- extract_bce_data(bce_data)
plot_fish_population(age_range, your_species_data$population_at_age)

# Keep going...

```

## **Conservation Recommendation Question:**

(Recommendations dependent on species reproduction age, size at age, and catch rate)

1.  What is the minimum catch size of your species and why?

2.  What could be a potential slot limit to also protect large spawners? Why would this be implemented?

3.  Why would there be catch limits for your species? What is a real-world example of a catch limit for your species
